* When a member [[makes a suggestion|Suggesting a resolution]], the Secretary will receive an email notification:

* Follow the link to see your options for this suggestion:

* If the Board decides to proceed with this proposal, you can either:
    * start an electronic vote immediately; or
    * add it to a future meeting agenda.
* In both cases, it is possible to edit the wording of the proposal before opening it up to the membership.
* If the Board decides not to proceed with this proposal, you can simply ignore it.

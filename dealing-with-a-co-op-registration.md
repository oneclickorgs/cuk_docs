* When a draft co-op is submitted for registration, all admins will receive a notification email like this:

[[admin_coop_proposed_email.png]]

* Follow the link to the list of submitted co-ops, and click 'View full information':

* You have contact information for the founder members, and can download the Rules and registration form that they have prepared.
* It is likely that some amendments will be necessary. The founder members are still able to edit the Rules and registration form at this stage, so they can act on any changes that you request.
* The rest of the registration proceeds as normal: the founders need to sign a hard copy of the documents, and these are submitted to the FCA in the usual way.
* Once the FCA has completed the registration, return to this page, and press the **Approve registration** button:

* This will unlock all the governance features of the website for this co-op.

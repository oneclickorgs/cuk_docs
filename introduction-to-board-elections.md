* Board elections are held in conjunction with an AGM. When convening the AGM, the Secretary chooses what parts of the election to do online.
* The two parts of the election are 'nominations' and 'voting'. You can choose to do the entire process offline; or you can choose to do just nominations online, or just voting online, or both parts online.
* If nominations are done online, the members can nominate and second each other, and the system will keep track of who the successful nominees are.
* If the voting is done online, either the nominations are done online as well, or the Secretary can manually input who the nominees are.
* The Secretary chooses the starting date for voting. Votes are then accepted between that date and the start of the AGM.
* Each Member votes by ranking the nominees in order of preference. If there are any nominees they do not wish to see elected, then they can leave them out of their ranking.
* The results are calculated using a Single Transferable Vote system, using the Meek counting method.

Setting up a new co-op involves a few steps:

1. Creating a user account, and setting up some basic information about the new co-op.
2. Inviting other Founder Members, and choosing who will be a Director, and who will be the Secretary.
3. Making the necessary insertions and options for the Rules of the co-op.
4. Filling in some questions from the Mutual Societies registration form.
5. Submitting the registration to Co-operatives UK.

These steps can all be done online by the Founder Members.
